#commone process states

Here are some common process states you might see:

R (Running or Runnable): The process is either running on a CPU or waiting to run.
S (Interruptible Sleep): The process is waiting for an event to complete or for a resource to become available.
D (Uninterruptible Sleep): The process is waiting for I/O (input/output) to complete and cannot be interrupted.
T (Stopped): The process has been stopped, usually by receiving a signal.
Z (Zombie): The process has completed execution, but its parent has not yet read its exit status, leaving it in a "zombie" state.
